Thank you for the effort and thought you have put into this proposal — it’s clear that the team has engaged seriously with a complex and globally relevant topic. The project is well-aligned with SDG 9 and 16, and your integration of AI techniques for both malware detection and NLP-driven threat intelligence is a strong and well-articulated foundation. The inclusion of explainable AI and behavioral analysis adds depth and shows technical maturity.

To make the project more novel and impactful, you might consider exploring less conventional sources of threat intelligence, such as darknet forums or encrypted communication channels, which could provide richer and more diverse training data. Additionally, incorporating real-time or adaptive learning mechanisms — such as continual learning or reinforcement learning-based threat adaptation — could help the system evolve in response to emerging threats. Finally, developing a federated or decentralized version of the system could open up new use cases for privacy-preserving cyber defense, which is a rapidly growing area of research.
